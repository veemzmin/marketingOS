# Research Completion Report

**Project:** Marketing OS for Healthcare Content Governance
**Research Focus:** Features dimension for content governance platforms
**Researched:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Research Scope

Investigated feature landscape for:
1. Content marketing platforms (ContentCal, CoSchedule, Buffer)
2. Compliance/governance platforms (Sprinklr)
3. Marketing automation for healthcare/regulated industries
4. Mental health-specific requirements

## Key Findings

### Table Stakes (Must-Have for V1)
- Content Generation UI
- Policy Validation Engine (real-time)
- Role-Based Access Control
- Approval Workflow (state machine)
- Immutable Audit Trail (HIPAA)
- Content Review Interface

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)
- Mental Health Stigma Checker (not in Buffer/CoSchedule)
- Medication/Diagnosis Claim Validator
- Approval SLAs + Escalation
- Evidence-Based Guidance

### Anti-Features (Don't Build)
- Multi-channel Publishing
- Analytics/Engagement Metrics
- Content Templates
- Batch Approval
- Collaborative Editing

## Confidence Levels

Table Stakes: HIGH
Regulatory Requirements: HIGH
Governance Patterns: MEDIUM-HIGH
Mental Health Rules: MEDIUM (need stakeholder interviews)
Architecture: MEDIUM-HIGH
Anti-features: HIGH

## Research Files Created

- .planning/research/FEATURES.md (comprehensive, 290+ lines)
- .planning/research/SUMMARY.md (executive summary)
- .planning/research/PITFALLS.md (healthcare-specific)
- .planning/research/STACK.md (technology stack)
- .planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)

## Quality Gate Status

✓ Categories clear (table stakes vs differentiators vs anti-features)
✓ Complexity noted (Low/Medium/High with time estimates)
✓ Dependencies identified (feature dependency diagram)
✓ Healthcare context considered (mental health specific section)

## Ready for Roadmap

All research objectives complete. Feature landscape ready for phase structure design.
